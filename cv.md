## About me
 
I started my way into programming at the end of 2019, and it wasn’t JavaScript.
I have studied Java on the Javarush platform and was delighted with what I was doing.

After a while, I realized that something is wrong and I don’t see the result, just learning, learning and learning. So I decided to change my path a bit.

I saw the RSSchool course preview. And I thought that this is what I was looking for!
Two weeks for the basis of JS and here I am.
